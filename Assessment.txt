Data Engineering Case Study: Addressing Challenges in Digital Advertising

Data Ingestion:

Scalable System: Develop a robust data ingestion system leveraging tools like Apache Kafka to handle real-time streaming of ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro).
High Volume Handling: Utilize distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark to efficiently process high volumes of data in both real-time and batch modes.
Data Processing:

Standardization and Enrichment: Implement ETL processes using Apache NiFi or Apache Beam to standardize data formats across sources and enrich them with additional metadata.
Correlation Logic: Utilize machine learning algorithms or SQL joins to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions, providing valuable insights into campaign performance.
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Storage Solution: Select a scalable data warehousing solution like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for efficient storage of processed data, enabling fast querying and analysis.
Optimization: Utilize columnar storage formats like Parquet and optimize data partitioning for improved query performance during analytical operations.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms using tools like Apache Flink or Apache Storm to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays in real-time.
Alerting Mechanisms: Set up alerting mechanisms with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to notify stakeholders of data quality issues promptly, ensuring timely resolution and maintaining campaign effectiveness.
By addressing these challenges and implementing scalable, efficient solutions for data ingestion, processing, storage, and monitoring, AdvertiseX can streamline its operations and gain valuable insights to optimize ad campaign performance effectively.
